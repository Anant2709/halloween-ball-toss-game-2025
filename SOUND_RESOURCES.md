# üîä Sound Resources for Halloween Ball Toss Game

You can use the built-in beep sounds, or add custom sound files for a better experience!

## Quick Setup (Using Built-in Beeps)

The Python script already includes built-in beep sounds that will play automatically if no sound files are found. **You can start playing right away without any sound files!**

- **Good hit**: Three ascending beeps (cheerful)
- **Bad hit**: Two descending beeps (sad)

## Adding Custom Sounds

For a more professional game experience, add these two files to the project folder:

1. `good_sound.wav` - Success/correct sound
2. `bad_sound.wav` - Failure/wrong sound

### Format Requirements:
- **File format**: `.wav` (recommended) or `.ogg`
- **Sample rate**: 22050 Hz or 44100 Hz
- **Duration**: 0.5 - 3 seconds (short sounds work best)
